1️⃣ Zero Flag (ZF)

    Indicates whether the result of an operation is zero.

    If the result of an arithmetic/logical operation is 0, ZF is set to 1.

    Otherwise, ZF is 0.

2️⃣ Carry Flag (CF)

    Indicates if a carry (overflow) occurs in arithmetic operations.

    Used when numbers exceed their maximum storage capacity (e.g., in an 8-bit register, if a sum exceeds 255, a carry occurs).
